                    Ronald Reagan was apart of the Republican Party.
                    Ronald Reagan was a two term President and for his first term Ronald Reagan (for President) and George Bush (for Vice President) went up against
                    against Jimmy Carter (the sitting President) and Walter Mondale (sitting Vice President). In this election Ronald Reagan won the Presidency in a landslide.
                    During the campaign Reagan wanted to bring America back to its former greatness, to give the people of America hope that America’s best days were still ahead, and also he 
                    talked about revival in America itself…ex: including recapturing American people’s pride in themselves and in America itself during the campaign as well.

                        <!--Text that talks about Ronald Reagan Assination Attempt-->
                        On March 30th, 1981 Ronald Reagan had an assassination attempt (an attempted one, he did not die from it).
                        Ronald Reagan made a speech at the Hilton Hotel in Washington D.C. to the Construction Trades Council, after 
                        the speech Reagan exited the hotel and headed to his car and that is when the attempt happened. The Secret Service immediately went to protect Ronald Reagan, and 
                        he was thrown into the car and Secret Service agent Jerry Parr jumped on top of him, and ordered the driver to go to the White House. Reagan suffered a punctured lung 
                        from a bullet and that bullet also went very close to Reagan’s heart. The gunman who did this attempt was a man named John Hinckley Jr.
                        Reagan’s doctors allowed him to return to the White House on April 11th, 1981.
